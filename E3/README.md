An implementation of a buffer using counting semaphores to coordinate threads accessing the buffer.

E3 is a shell that follows the rules of E1 except that is only prints 80 character lines. Characters exceeding 80 will feed into the next line and will not be printed until the following line reaches 80.

Note that StateThreads was used in this exercise but is not included here.
